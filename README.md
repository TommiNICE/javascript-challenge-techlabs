# javascript-challenge-techlabs
For the JavaScript challenge of my online coding bootcamp, I had the idea to build a simple web application where a user can create and manage pro and contra arguments. Users can add new arguments, update existing ones, and delete individual entries.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TommiNICE/javascript-challenge-techlabs

cd javascript-challenge-techlabs
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start JSON server
```bash
npm start
```

4. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.
